# Analogical Clock
A simple project to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript through the creation of an analogical clock.

This project uses the [WorldTimeAPI](https://worldtimeapi.org/) to fetch real-time data of the current date in a specific timezone.

This project is intended to be run together with its server that can be found here: [Analogical Clock Server](https://github.com/julianocts98/analogical-clock-server).

## How to use
Clone to your machine and simply open ``index.html``.

## TODO

- [X] Add functional hour and minute pointers. 
- [X] Add ticks and numbers to the clock's interface.
- [X] Add timezone selector for the clock.
- [X] Make clock work properly after selected a timezone even if internet loses connection.
- [ ] Let users be able to create **Timezone rooms**.
- [ ] Let users be able to connect into rooms already created through their room ID.
- [ ] Fetch timezone data directly from the server instead of doing it in the client.
