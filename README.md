# Analogical Clock

A simple project to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript through the creation of an analogical clock.

This project uses the [WorldTimeAPI](https://worldtimeapi.org/) to fetch real-time data of the current date in a specific timezone.

This project is intended to be run together with its server that can be found here: [Analogical Clock Server](https://github.com/julianocts98/analogical-clock-server).

## How to use

Clone to your machine and simply open `index.html`.
